 * This class is the companion to ZNetSenderTest.java, and as such, it receives packets sent by ZNetSenderTest.java
 * See the ZNetSenderTest.java for information on how to configure your XBee for this demo
 * 
 * If you want to test receiving RX packets from the coordinator, connect to the end device and run
 * 
 * If you want to test receiving I/O samples from an end device, connect to your coordinator and run
 * 
 * You can start ZNetSenderTest.java and this class in any order but it's generally best to start this class first.
